				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<h2>INSPIRATIONS AND BACKGROUND</h2>
				<p>My name is Camryn Wilson but most people call me Camy. I am currently a junior at Chico State as a Media Arts Design and Technology major with a focus on production. I have a passion for film and am exploring production career paths to highlight my organizational, leadership, creativity, hands-on and task-oriented skills.</p>
				<p>I am originally from Folsom, CA, but have been living in Chico during the pandemic.  I spend the majority of my time outside of school serving as a leader for the Christian club on campus known as Cru developing, editing, and producing content for their virtual and now in-person functions. I hope to bring my faith into the line of work I end up in whether that is improving the production value of films in the Christian film industry or incorporating Christian morals into tv and film storylines. Ultimately, I think the influence media platforms have on individuals in society is a great opportunity to give representation to different ways of living.</p>
				<p>The passion I have for working in the film industry stems from my experience as a child actor both on stage and in front of the camera. I loved seeing the different parts of how a play, film, or commercial came together. Below you can find some of the available videos I have saved over those years.</p>
				<p>Another significant impact on my career choice is my involvement for 7 years at a Summer Fine Arts Camp known as Sugarloaf. There I majored in courses ranging from Theatre to Digital Audio Recording picking up many of the skills I still possess and expand upon today.</p>
				<p>Across these years of work, I applied myself to many different leadership positions in service and outreach clubs, nonprofits, and athletics, which drove my passion for working on a team. My height is a big part of my identity as I am only 4’10” but this has never stopped me from playing the sports that I love such as soccer and tennis, striving for leadership positions, and generating and creating ideas and projects for prospective clients. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me. Please feel free to contact me for further questions or opportunities.</p>
